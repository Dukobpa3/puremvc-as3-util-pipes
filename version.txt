0.3 - Exposed the PipeListener class, which was previously an 'inner class'
      defined and used only inside Junction. It's useful for unit testing,
      though, and for simple pipeline scenarios, you may not prefer to use
      the Junction class and just set a listener on the end of the pipe
      yourself. 

0.2 - Checked in API Docs for the utility, updating a bunch of the inline
      code comments. Also, added the functionality for Filter instances
      to have instance names and to receive their parameters via control
      messages. 
      
0.1 - Checked in initial classes and license/version files. Most of the
      functionality is expected to work at this point, though there are
      as yet no unit tests or demos. Also, this has been through the 
      refactor ringer prior to checkin, so I don't expect a lot of churn
      in package/class names. - CLH
